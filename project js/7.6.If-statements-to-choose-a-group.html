The next example contains a program that reads a boy’s age from the keyboard and determines which scouting group he should attend.
 The program uses these criteria to choose the correct group.

Age	                            Group
7	                            Tiger
8	                            Wolf
9	                            Bear
10	                            Webelos
between 11 and 13, inclusive	Boy Scout
between 14 and 20, inclusive	Venture
