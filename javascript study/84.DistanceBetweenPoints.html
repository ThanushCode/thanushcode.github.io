/* Input: x and y for two points: x1, y1, x2, y2
 * Processing:
 *   1. Calculate the distance between the two points.
 *   2. Round the distance to two digits after the decimal.
 * Output: the rounded distance
 * The built in JavaScript Math object has a function named Math.round that rounds a real number to an integer. However, 
 * a programmer will occasionally need to write a program that rounds fractional numbers to a fixed number of places after the
 *  decimal point. For example, U.S. currency amounts are usually rounded to two decimal places (pennies). Lines 27–29 of the
 *  next example use the built in Math.pow and Math.round functions to round the value in the variable named dist to two decimal
 *  places.
 * Figure 5-2 shows a plot of two points in two-dimensional Cartesian space and the distance between those points. 
 * We can compute the distance between two points p1 and p2 with the formula:

* d = √
* (x2 − x1)2 + (y2 − y1)2
* where d is the distance between the points. Point p1 has the coordinates (x1, y1), and point p2 has the coordinates (x2, y2).
* This formula can be written in JavaScript as shown in the next example. Notice the use of the built-in JavaScript
* function Math.sqrt at line 24.
