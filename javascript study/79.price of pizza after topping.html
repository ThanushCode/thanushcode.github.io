    //Imagine a program to compute the price of a pizza. The price of a large sized cheese pizza with no other toppings is $10.95.
// The price for each topping such as ham, peperoni, olives, and pineapple is $1.45. 
//Here is a short example that uses the += operator to compute the price of a pizza.
// let price = 10.95;
//let toppings = 3;
   // let perTopping = 1.45;
   // price += toppings * perTopping;

let price = 10.95;

let perTopping = 1.45;
let totalprice = price + toppings * perTopping;
