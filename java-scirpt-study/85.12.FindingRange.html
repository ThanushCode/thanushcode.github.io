        Sometimes a computer program has a list of numerical ranges and must find the range that contains some value. Examples of this type of computing problem include:

determining a person’s income tax rate from a list of income ranges and graduated tax rates
determining a customer’s discount rate from a list of purchase ranges and discount rates
determining a salesperson’s commission from a list of sales ranges and commission rates
determining a student’s letter grade from a list of score ranges and letter grades
For example, a company may offer discounts to its customers where the discount rate is based on the amount purchased according to this table.

If the purchase
amount is greater
than or equal to	  And thepurchase amountis less than   	Then thediscountrate is
0	                                     $300	                0%
$300	                                $600	                2.0%
$600	                                $1000	                2.5%
$1000	                                ∞	                    3.0%

A beginning programmer will often code a JavaScript solution to this problem like this:
        */
// Computes and returns a discounted purchase amount.
function getDiscountedAmount(purchase) {
    let rate;
    if (purchase < 300) {
        rate = 0;
    }
    else if (purchase < 600) {
        rate = 0.02;
    }
    else if (purchase < 1000) {
        rate = 0.025;
    }
    else {
        rate = 0.03;
    }
    let discount = purchase * rate;
    return purchase - discount;
}
