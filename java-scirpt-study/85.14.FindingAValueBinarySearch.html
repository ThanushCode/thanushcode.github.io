Finding a Value (Binary Search)
If the elements in an array are sorted, then the computer can use a faster algorithm called binary search
 to find an element within that array. The binary search algorithm works by comparing the key to the middle
  most element in the array. If the key is greater than the middle most element, then the search is repeated
   in the last half of the array. If the key is less than the middle most element, then the search is
    repeated in the first half of the array. Of course, if the key is equal to the middle most element,
     then the key has been found and the search is done. This process of comparing the key to the middle
      most element of the current interval is repeated until the key is found or the interval has shrunk
       to only one element. If that one element is not the same as the key, then the key is not present 
       in the array, and the function below returns a negative value.

function binarySearch(list, key) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = list.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        // Compute the index of the middle of the current interval.
        let mid = left + ((right - left) >>> 1);

        // Compare the value in the middle of the interval to the key.
        let cmp = key - list[mid];
        if (cmp > 0) {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
        else if (cmp < 0) {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
        else {
            return mid;
        }
    }

    // key is not present in list, but if it
    // were, it would be stored at location left.
    return -(left + 1);
