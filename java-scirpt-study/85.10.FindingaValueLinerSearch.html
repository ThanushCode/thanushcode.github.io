 /*
Very often a computer program must determine if a certain value is stored in an array
 or not and if stored in the array, then return the value’s location. The value to be 
 found is called the key. If the array is not too large (perhaps less than 100 elements), 
 finding the key can be easily done using a linear search. A linear search is done by comparing
  each element in the array with the key until the key is found in the array or the end of the array 
  is reached.

The advantage of a linear search is that it is simple and easy to code.
 The disadvantage is that it is too slow if the array has many elements in it.
  When the array has many elements in it, it is probably faster to sort the array 
  and keep it sorted and to use a binary search to find the key within the array.

JavaScript code to perform a linear search is shown below. In the example,
 if the key is found in the array, the search function returns the index of the location within 
 the array where the key was found. If the key is not found, the search function returns −1.

Example 13
 */

// If key is in list, returns the first index where
// key is located within list; otherwise returns -1.
function linearSearch(list, key) {
    for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        if (list[i] == key) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
