            Within the parentheses of a for loop there must always be three statements separated by two semicolons. The three statements are:
            1.The initialization statement which is executed only once at the beginning of the loop.
            2.The condition that the computer checks to see if it should continue to execute the statements inside the body of the loop.
            The computer checks this condition after the initialization statement and each time at the beginning of the loop.
            3.The update statement that the computer executes each time through the loop as if it were written as the last statement in
            the body of the loop.
