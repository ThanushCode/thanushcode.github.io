      /*
      A bank will not loan money to a homebuyer unless the homebuyer pays for part of the house at the time of purchase.
       This initial payment is called a down payment and is based on the cost of the home.
        The Bank of Ririe calculates down payments according to this schedule:

      Cost of House		                 Down Payment
      $0	–	$49,999.99		               5% * cost
      $50,000	–	$99,999.99		          $2,000 + 10% * (cost − $50,000)
      $100,000	–	$199,999.99		      $7,500 + 20% * (cost − $100,000)
      $200,000	–	∞		              $27,500 +     25% * (cost − $200,000)

       */

      function downPaymentCalculation() {
        let cost = parseInt(document.getElementById("homeTotalValue").value);
        let downPayment;

        if (cost >= 0 && cost <= 49999.99) {
          downPayment = "( 5% * cost)";
        } else if (cost >= 50000 && cost <= 99999.99) {
          downPayment = "2,000 + 10% * (cost − 50,000)";
        } else if (cost >= 100000 && cost <= 199999.99) {
          downPayment = "7,500 + 20% * (cost − 100,000)";
        } else if (cost >= 200000) {
          downPayment = "27,500 + 25% * (cost − 200,000)";
        } else {
          downPayment = "Not able to Apply for Loan";
        }

        document.getElementById("output").innerHTML = downPayment;
