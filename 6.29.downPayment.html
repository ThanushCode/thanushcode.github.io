    A bank will not loan money to a homebuyer unless the homebuyer pays for part of the house at the time of purchase.
     This initial payment is called a down payment and is based on the cost of the home.
      The Bank of Ririe calculates down payments according to this schedule:

    Cost of House		                 Down Payment
    $0	–	$49,999.99		               5% * cost
    $50,000	–	$99,999.99		          $2,000 + 10% * (cost − $50,000)
    $100,000	–	$199,999.99		      $7,500 + 20% * (cost − $100,000)
    $200,000	–	∞		              $27,500 +     25% * (cost − $200,000)

     */

      let costofHouse = parseInt(document.getElementById("amount").value);

        downPayment = "$2,000 + 10% * (cost − $50,000)";
      } else if (costofHouse >= 100000 && costofHouse <= 199999.99) {
