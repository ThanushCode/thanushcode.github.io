      Instructions
You work for a retail store that wants to increase sales on Tuesday and Wednesday which are the store’s slowest sales days. 
In a file named discount.html, write a program that takes a customer’s subtotal amount as input and if the 

subtotal is greater than $50and today is Tuesday or Wednesday,the program should subtract 10% from the subtotal.

Your program should then compute and output the 

total amount due by adding sales tax of 6% to the subtotal.

You must use a compound condition and only one if block to solve this problem.

Help
Within your program, use this JavaScript code that will get the current day of the week from your computer’s clock:

    var dayOfWeek = new Date().getDay();
If you use the above code, the variable dayOfWeek will hold 0 if today is Sunday, 1 if today is Monday, and so on to 6 if today 
is Saturday.
