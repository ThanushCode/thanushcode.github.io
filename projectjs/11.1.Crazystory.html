        /* 
Write an HTML document with a button and a div. The onclick attribute of the button must call a function
 named crazyStory() with no arguments. The div must have an id of 'output'. 
 Write these five functions in the head of the document, all in the same script tag:

    function chooseNoun()
    function chooseVerb()
    function chooseAdjective()
    function chooseAdverb()
    function chooseInteger()

The first four functions must each contain an array with at least ten words. 
The chooseNoun function must contain an array with at least ten nouns. 
The chooseVerb function must contain an array with at least ten verbs, and so on. When one of these four functions is called, 
the function must randomly choose one of the words in its array and return that word. 

Hint: write code similar to example 8 of Chapter 9 to get a pseudo random index between 0 and
 the length of the array of words, in other words in this range [0, length). Then write code to return
the word that is stored in the array at that index.

The last function, chooseInteger must return a pseudo random integer between 1 and 99, inclusive. 
Finally add this function to the same script tag as the other five functions.

        + chooseVerb() + "ing a horse. The horse is "

    let max = 11;

    // Call the Math.random and Math.floor functions.
    let r = min + Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min));

    // Display the random integer for the user to see.
