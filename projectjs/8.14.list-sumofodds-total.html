      Instructions

In a file named, sumOdds.html, write a program that asks the user for an integer n and then outputs the sum of all the odd integers between 1 and n, inclusive.
For example,
  if a user entered 10, your program would add 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 and output 25.

  If a user entered 11, your program would add 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 and output 36.

Requirements
Your program must include code comments which are planning tools you used to break this problem down and to label parts.
Your program must use a repetition structure. 
Your program must be running on your GitHub Pages account.
