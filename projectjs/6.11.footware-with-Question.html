   Instructions
In a file named footwear.html, write a JavaScript program that helps a user choose the correct footwear for the day's weather. The table that follows shows the weather types the user may enter and what your program should output.
Include code comments for input, processing, and output as part of your program planning.
Share your code comments (pseudocode, or related) with others in the W06 ðŸŽˆ Discussion: Developer Forum
Be sure to review the program requirements below.
Post and submit your URL for this program.

Weather  	Foot Wear
hot	sandals
rain	galoshes
snow	boots
unknown	shoes
Requirements
Use the base template for the class as your starting point.
Use an external JavaScript file and as always, store that file in your js or scripts folder.
Use an HTML select element / combo box (Links to an external site.) to to guide the users selection to only the four given in the table.
Be sure to add a default, non-selectable value to your select element.
Use a button click to handle the selection OR you may respond to a valid selection from the select element.
Validate the HTML (Links to an external site.)  and CSS.
