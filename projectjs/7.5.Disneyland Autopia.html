              Disneyland Autopia
      According to the Disneyland website, guests wishing to drive a car on the Autopia must meet one of the following height requirements:

      54 inches (137 cm) or taller to drive alone
      32 inches (81 cm) or taller and accompanied by a passenger 54 inches or taller

      Here is a JavaScript program that accepts the height of a driver and an optional passenger and
      uses the logical operators || and && to determine if they may ride the Autopia. 
      
      Notice the use of parentheses in the if statement to ensure the logic is correct. 

      The program outputs either“Enjoy the ride!” or “Sorry, 
      
      to drive a car on the Autopia you must be at least 54 inches tall
       or at least 32 inches tall and accompanied by a passenger who is at least 54 inches tall.”
              */
             /* Input: the height of a driver and an optional passenger
       * Processing: Determine if a driver and
