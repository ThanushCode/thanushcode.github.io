      /*  Finding a Range
      Sometimes a computer program has a list of numerical ranges and must find the range that contains some value. Examples of this type of computing problem include:

      determining a person’s income tax rate from a list of income ranges and graduated tax rates
      determining a customer’s discount rate from a list of purchase ranges and discount rates
      determining a salesperson’s commission from a list of sales ranges and commission rates
      determining a student’s letter grade from a list of score ranges and letter grades
      For example, a company may offer discounts to its customers where the discount rate is based on the amount purchased according to this table.

      If the purchase                 And the                               Then the
      amount is greater              purchase amouis less than              discount
      thanor equal to                                                        rate is
