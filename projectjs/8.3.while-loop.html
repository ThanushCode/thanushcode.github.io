 while
Use a while loop when:
You need a simple counting loop; or
You cannot use a simple counting loop, so you must use a sentinel controlled loop, the sentinel must be checked before executing the statements inside the loop.

1.reserve space in main memory for a variable named i and store the value 1 into it
2.test if i is less than 3, which is true
3.because i is less than 3, execute the statements in the body of the while loop
    a,open a popup window that contains the number 1 and wait for the user to click OK in the popup window
    b,add 1 to i so that its new value is 2
4.test if i is less than 3, which is true
5.because i is less than 3, execute the statements in the body of the while loop
    a,open a popup window that contains the number 2 and wait for the user to click OK in the popup window
    b,add 1 to i so that its new value is 3
6.test if i is less than 3, which is false
7.because i is not less than 3, skip the statements that are in the body of the loop and execute the statements that are written after the body of the loop
