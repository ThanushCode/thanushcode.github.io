/*
In a file named alarm.html, write a program that determines if you can sleep in or not. 
Your program should get all its input from your computer’s clock. 
= On all weekdays 
“Get up!” will be "else" statement
1. (Monday through Friday) that are not holidays, 
your program should output 
 On all other

 “Sleep in.”   if statement used (becouse all data given ) 
 The four holidays will be grouped 
1.that your program must check for are January 1 (New Year’s Day),  ( month == 0 && dayOfMonth == 1)
2.July 4 (U.S. Independence Day), ( month == 6 && dayOfMonth == 4  ) 
3.and December 25 (Christmas).  () month == 11 && dayOfMonth == 4 ) 
4. days (weekends and holidays) your program should output “Sleep in.”  sat and sun ( dayOfWeek == 0 && dayOfWeek == 6 )  

You don’t need to include other holidays in your program because 
most other holidays do not occur on a fixed day each year.

Within your program, use this JavaScript code that will get the current month,
 current day of the month, and current day of the week from your computer’s clock:

    var now = new Date();
    var month = now.getMonth();
    var dayOfMonth = now.getDate();
    var dayOfWeek = now.getDay();

If you use the above code, the variable month will hold 0 if the current month is January, 
1 if February, and so on to 11 if December. 
The variable dayOfMonth will hold 1 for the first day of the month up to 28, 29, 30, or 31 for the last day of the month. 
The variable dayOfWeek will hold 0 if today is Sunday, 1 if today is Monday, and so on to 6 if today is Saturday.

- You must use a compound condition.
