        /*
       A university library that loans books to students, faculty, and the public has a written policy that determines 
how long someone may borrow a book before it is due. This table shows the criteria and length of time that someone
 is allowed to borrow a book.

 Write a defining table and a JavaScript program that determines how long a person may borrow a book. 
 Your program must allow a librarian to enter a person’s status: “student”, “faculty”, or “other” and
  how many books the person has kept past the due date in the last year.
