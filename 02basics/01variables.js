var fullName = "Thanush Ganesh"; // we are going to make memory in computer fullName and create a data on that memory "Thanush Ganesh"

// how to name variable 
 // fullName = camelcase 
// full-name
//full_name
// Full-Name ignore this 

var courseName = "Introduction to JS"; // every string that need to put inside the dubble qoutes HOS STRING STORED

var isLoggedIn = false; // or true dont put capital letter on start True mean - 1 and false mean -0 + HOW BOOLEAN VALES ARE STORED
                        // to check people are logged in or not and this kind of data type known as boolyan data type

var loggedCount = 34;   // how many time users are logeed into application, if we pyt "34" inside dubble quotes it will become string and without that number ? HOW NUMBERS ARE STORED    

//console.log(loggedCount);  without dubble qoutes we are referncing them and there value should be displaynode
//console.log("loggedCount"); with duble qoutes mean we want to display as it is
var paymentMode; // if you dont stor anything its undefined //we are not putting any value becouse we dont know what amout they pay: / if we run with console log it will give undefine data type


paymentMode = "credit Card";
console.log(paymentMode);
