            The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6.
            (Sunday=0, Monday=1, Tuesday=2 ..)
            This example uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:
            
            This is how it works:

           The switch expression is evaluated once.
           The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
           If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
           If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

         The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6.
