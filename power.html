/*
Write a JavaScript program in a single HTML file (embed your script) named power.html that does not require input that uses a loop to build a single string output of all powers of 2 from LaTeX: 2^02 0 up to LaTeX: 2^{31}2 31, inclusive. You can choose to use a button to call a function or have no function and just run the code. Your choice.

The output must have the following format:  1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2147483648
where there is a comma and space between each value and there is no comma after the last value. Your output does not need to be green.

Notation Help in case you are not familiar with standard notations: The dot dot dot (...) in the example output references that fact that there are a lot of values between the two example output values.

Submit your HTML document that contains your HTML interface and embedded JavaScript code.
