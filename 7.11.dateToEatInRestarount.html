Write defining table and then a program to determine if you and your date will be allowed 
to eat in a fancy and fashionable
 restaurant. Your program should read two integers from the keyboard, 
   one that specifies your fashion measure from 1 to 10,inclusive and one that specifies your date’s fashion measure from 1 to 10,
 inclusive. 
 If either of your fashion measures is 2 or less, your program should output “Not a chance”. 
 If either of your fashion measures is 8 or greater, your program should output “Welcome”.
  If your fashion measures sum to more than 12 your program should output, “Maybe”. Otherwise, 
  your program should output “Unlikely”.
